Consumer behavior remains value-oriented and bifurcated, while platforms like Amazon, Shopify, eBay, and The RealReal lean into focused execution and sober investment as the industry shifts from defense to offense heading into 2026.</description>

      <description>Software stocks have fallen sharply in early 2026, with valuation multiples compressing across the sector. This episode examines whether the sell-off reflects structural disruption from AI or a market overreaction, introduces the “artificial limiters” framework for identifying defensible platforms, and explores why mission-critical SaaS may prove more resilient than feared. It also contrasts public-market opportunity with rising risk in venture investing during this AI transition.</description>
