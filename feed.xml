This episode examines whether the sell-off reflects structural disruption from AI or a market overreaction, introduces the “artificial limiters” framework for identifying defensible platforms, and explores why mission-critical SaaS may prove more resilient than feared. It also contrasts public-market opportunity with rising risk in venture investing during this AI transition.</description>
